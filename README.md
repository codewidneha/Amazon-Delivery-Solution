# Amazon Delivery Solution

## üì¶ Overview

The **Amazon Delivery Solution** is a sophisticated logistics system designed to optimize delivery operations for Amazon. It incorporates real-time tracking, route optimization, inventory management, and more, all built to scale and meet the growing needs of modern delivery services. The system is developed with React 17.0.2 for the frontend and supports robust backend features using Java, Python, and integrated APIs.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Real-time Order Tracking**: Stay updated on the status of each order, from dispatch to delivery.
- **Route Optimization Engine**: Employs advanced algorithms like A* and Genetic Algorithms to find the best delivery routes.
- **Automated Driver Assignment**: Automatically assigns drivers based on availability and order proximity.
- **Inventory Management**: Efficiently tracks and manages warehouse inventory across multiple locations.
- **Customer Notifications**: Sends timely updates to customers regarding their order status.
- **Scalable and Modular Architecture**: Built to handle large fleets and scalable operations.
- **API Integration**: Easily integrates with Amazon's APIs for seamless data flow.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: 
  - **React 17.0.2**: Used for building an interactive, responsive UI.
  - **Redux**: For state management across the application.
  - **Axios**: For making API requests to the backend.
- **Backend**:
  - **Java (Spring Boot)** and **Python (Flask)**: For building robust backend services.
  - **Google Maps API**: For real-time routing and geolocation.
  - **Node.js**: If applicable, for additional microservices or the frontend server.
- **Database**:
  - **MySQL** or **PostgreSQL**: For storing and managing relational data.
  - **Redis**: For caching frequently accessed data to improve performance.
- **Version Control**: **Git** for version control.

## üîß Installation

### Clone the repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codewidneha/Amazon-Delivery-Solution.git
```

### Backend Setup

#### For Java (Spring Boot)

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

#### For Python (Flask)

1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

### Frontend Setup (React)

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The app should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Usage

1. Access the backend API via `http://localhost:8080` (for Java) or `http://localhost:5000` (for Python).
2. The React frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` for viewing and interacting with the user interface.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Architecture

The system follows a **microservices architecture** with the following components:

- **Order Service**: Manages order lifecycle from placement to delivery.
- **Routing Service**: Optimizes delivery routes using algorithms.
- **Inventory Service**: Tracks and manages warehouse inventory.
- **Driver Assignment Service**: Automatically assigns drivers based on various parameters.
- **Notification Service**: Sends notifications to customers about their orders.

### API Endpoints

- **GET** `/api/orders/{orderId}`: Retrieve details of an order.
- **POST** `/api/orders`: Place a new order.
- **GET** `/api/routes/{orderId}`: Get the optimized route for a specific order.
- **POST** `/api/assign-driver`: Assign a driver to an order.
